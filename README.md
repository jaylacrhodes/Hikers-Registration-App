Hikers-Registration-App

Purpose:
A hiking registration app allows hikers to register for one of three Virginia guided hikes to qualify for the Great Outdoors badge.

Algorithms:
The hiking registration app has two text fields: One requests the number of hikers who want a guided tour ($16.99 each) and the other requests the location. A Spinner component allows the hiker to select one of the three possible locations: Peaks of Otter, New River Trail, and Crabtree Falls. The app also displays a title, an image, and a Button component (Figure 3-35).

After the user clicks the Button component (color #7E977E), the selected location and the total cost are displayed in a TextView component (Figure 3-36). The background color is #7E977E.

Conditions:
Use a title, an image (hike.png), a Spinner prompt, a string array, and a hint attribute.
